### TIPS

- To draw hair that gradually tapers or smooth hair, select Fill during rendering.  
- Textures and gradients are effective for expressing highlights and depth.  
- Plucking your own nose hairs and body hair for observation makes it easier to understand more realistic expressions.
- This extension draws attention to critical elements you absolutely must not overlook in drawings, but you'll earn disapproval if you don't remove it before submitting to your boss.
